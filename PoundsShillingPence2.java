/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10:  10 
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:  5
    3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:  5
   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:  10
   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:  10
   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:  10
   7. Did I read the input correctly from the user using (an) appropriate question(s)?
       Mark out of 10:  8 - I believe that the question I used is sufficient, but not very user friendly. 
   8. Did I compute the answer correctly for all cases?
       Mark out of 20: 20     
   9. Did I output the correct answer in the correct format (as shown in the examples)?
       Mark out of 10: 10 - Although I did get the program to print the answer in the correct format, I had to use an extra 
        					line of code to correct the decimal places and I suspect there could be a better way to do this,
        					perhaps using slightly different computations.
   10. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 10:  9, I find it difficult to accurately asses my own work without being either too critical or too lenient.
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks): 97
